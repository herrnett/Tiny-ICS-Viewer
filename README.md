# Tiny-ICS-Viewer
Small program that displays the most important information from .ics files.
Just drag and drop the .ics you want to look at into the application window and it'll show you start and end date (DD.MM.YYYY), time zone, location, title and description event.

Known issues: The description is truncated at newlines; if this occurs, the .ics file must be opened in a regular text editor and searched for "DESCRIPTION:" to read the full description.
