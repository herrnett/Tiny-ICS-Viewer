![screenshot](https://github.com/herrnett/Tiny-ICS-Viewer/blob/main/screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

Small program that displays the most important information from .ics files.
Simply drag and drop the .ics you want to look at into the application window and it'll show you start and end date (DD.MM.YYYY), time zone, location, title and description event.

Known issues: Will only display the first event of a file containing multiple events.
